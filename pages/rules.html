        <p>
            The rules of Higher or Lower are simple, you start by either pick higher or lower. If you think you'll throw higher than the Computer click on higher if you think you'll throw lower click on lower, after that insert the amount of credits you want to bet. If you've done all that press on the two throw buttons and find out who won! When you run out of credits, you'll get a pop-up saying explaining that you ran out of credits and you will be sent back to the homepage. Also, if you bet on a draw and you get it right you'll get quadruple the reward!
